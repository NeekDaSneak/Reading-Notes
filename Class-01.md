## How to do a Windows Backup

Why does this matter

This is how you will revert back to a more stable state before your computer started acting funny with those downloaded programs.

System Restore at the time you created it will save all the information from that point before you make or do certain changes.

This is a really helpful tool to use when upgrading or downloading new software just incase something funky happens.

In Windows settings you can search for system restore and create it from there and walk thru the steps.

Once it completes you have succesfully created a restore point to be used in case of emergency.
