## **Github Vs VsCode**

### *Why is this topic important?*

Defintely a lot to learn and a huge curveball thrown into the mix. But github is really nice once you can get the jist and the hang of things.

The way Github and vs code work hand in hand is pretty nice. Well microsoft owns them both so they should.

Github is where you can share code, connect and collaborate with people on different projects.

Github is where the code lives

So youll want to  make a nice profile add some information about yourself

VS Code (visual studio code) is where the magic happens.

That were youll type up your code.

This is the interface that youll use to

- add
- commit
- push

your work up to github so your collaborators or just the people your sharing with can see.

But its so much more than that theirs a terminal you can use that works just like the terminal on your computer.

You can install extensions to help you along the way or get pass certain hiccups.
